## Software Components:

* Keil uVision: Our main code runs on this application that runs on the microcontroller
* Stm32CubeMX: used for the microcontroller configurations 
* TeraTerm: used for debugging purposes for making sure that the data is being sent correctly from the microcontroller

## Hardware Components:

* STM32 Microcontroller
* DS18B20 "Digital Temperature Sensor" Breadboard
* Jumper Wires
* Power Supply (USB to Laptop)
* 4.7K Resistor
* Bluetooth module

## Languages used:
* C 

## Technical Challenges

* Finding alternatives in local stores for all the components 
* Adjusting CubeMX configurations as the sensor was sensitive to small changes in delay
