## Software Components:

* Keil uVision: Our main code runs on this application that runs on the microcontroller
* Stm32CubeMX: used for the microcontroller configurations 
* TeraTerm: used for debugging purposes for making sure that the data is being sent correctly from the microcontroller

## Hardware Components:

* STM32 Microcontroller
* DS18B20 "Digital Temperature Sensor" 
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires
* Power Supply (USB to Laptop)
* 4.7K Resistor
* Bluetooth module
