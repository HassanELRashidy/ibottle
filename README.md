## Software Components:

* Keil uVision: Our main code runs on this application that runs on the microcontroller
* Stm32CubeMX: used for the microcontroller configurations 
* TeraTerm: used for debugging purposes for making sure that the data is being sent correctly from the microcontroller

## Hardware Components:

* STM32 Microcontroller
* DS18B20 "Digital Temperature Sensor" 
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires
* Power Supply (USB to Laptop)
* 4.7K Resistor
* Bluetooth module

## Stm32cube configurations:

## Languages used:
* C 

## Technical Challenges

* Finding alternatives in local stores for all the components 
* Adjusting CubeMX configurations as the sensor was sensitive to small changes in delay

# Demo

* We got temperature from the DS18B20 successfully, sending out the temperature results using the bluetooth module to be displayed on the mobile application. The mobile application we used for now is Bluetooth serial terminal app for demo purposes.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75340968/140609625-26fcebae-ed19-46fc-b411-26808078f82c.png)
